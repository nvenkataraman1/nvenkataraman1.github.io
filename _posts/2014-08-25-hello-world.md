Hey there! My name is Narayanan "Naveen" Venkataraman and this is my website. I've built this website using [Poole using the Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
