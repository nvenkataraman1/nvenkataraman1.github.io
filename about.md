Hi, I'm Naveen :)

I am a current student at [The University of Chicago]((https://grahamschool.uchicago.edu/credit/master-science-analytics/index)) studying Applied Statistics, Predictive Analytics, Data Visualization and Machine Learning.

I have worked in consulting, product management, data analytics, strategy and business development with large technology companies and venture-funded startups. You can learn more about my work on [LinkedIn](http://linkd.in/nvenkataraman1) and browse thru my projects on [Github](https://github.com/nvenkataraman1).

I like using the following tools and am always learning new ones.

* Analysis: R, Julia, Excel
* Data Munging: tidyr, dplyr
* Visualization: ggplot2, rCharts, d3
* SQL

I'm also beginning to dabble with programming in Julia, mainly for visualization.
